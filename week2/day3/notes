conversion of data tupes form one to another is called typecasting

it is of 2 types :- primitive and non primitive

1.primitive - the conversion of one primitve data type into another primitive data type 
    types:- 
        a :- widening[Implicit typecasting](The conversion of smaller to bigger)
        b :- Narrowing[Explicit typecasting](the converion of bigger dataype to smaller datatype);

2.Non primitive:- the conversion of one non primitive datatype into another non primitive datatype is known
as non primitive typecasting 

    types:-
    a :- upcasting ()
    b :- downcasting()


    flow:-
    byte->short->int->long->float->double
    char->int->long->float->double


During narrowing data loss can happen
